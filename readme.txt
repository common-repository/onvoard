### AOV Progress Bar

When it comes to increasing your store's average order value (AOV), there's no better tool to use than AOV Progress Bar. AOV Progress Bar is an interactive progress bar that changes whenever customers add or remove items from cart. This motivates customers to subconsciously add more items to their cart in order to qualify for discounts.

### Back In Stock

A merchant loses revenue every time customers view an out-of-stock item. These revenue can be recovered if you have a way to notify customers when out-of-stock items are replenished. OnVoard's Back-In-Stock tool makes it easy for merchants to allow customers to subscribe for back in stock notifications and automatically notifies them when products are restocked.

### Reviews

Use reviews app to fully automate reviews collection process.

* Send review request emails after customer purchase.
* Follow up with reminder emails if the user didn't leave a review.
* Respond with a discount coupon if user leaves a review.
* Notify reviewers when their review has been responded by admin.

Finally, showcase product reviews on your site to turn customer voice into marketing engine.

### Product Recommender

Use product recommender app to boost average order value (AOV) with cross-sell recommendations like "Frequently Bought Together" and "Customers Who Bought This Also Bought". Below are types of product recommendations that we provide.

* Frequently Bought Together
* Also Bought

### Prompt ‑ Popups/Upsell

Most pop-up vendors are obsolete. They think of pop-ups only as a medium to collect leads. OnVoard Prompt is a generational product that reinvents what you can think you could create with pop-ups. Using Prompt, you will get tons of opportunities to engage onsite visitors and optimize store revenue. Here are some kinds of Prompts you can create

* Welcome new users with discount code for first purchase.
* Recommend products when user add cart item.
* Cross-sell products when user initiate checkout.
* Stop cart abandonment when a user with cart items tries to exit. Offer them discount or free shipping.
* Collect feedback.
